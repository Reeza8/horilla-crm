# Compose extensions once the app registry is fully populated.
#
# This module is imported by whichever app's AppLauncher._register_urls()
# happens to run first (commonly an early app such as horilla.contrib.core),
# which happens *during* AppConfig.ready() — before every app has finished
# loading, so django.apps.apps.ready is still False and extension apps that
# load later (e.g. custom_fields, the last app in INSTALLED_APPS) have not
# registered anything yet. Because this module is only ever imported once,
# calling bootstrap_extensions() directly here would silently no-op forever
# for any extension registered by a later-loading app.
#
# django.core.signals.request_started only fires once django.setup() has
# fully completed (a request cannot happen before app loading finishes), so
# it is a reliable "everything is actually ready" hook that works uniformly
# across WSGI, ASGI, and the test client.
