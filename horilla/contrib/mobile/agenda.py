Agenda: the signed-in user's tasks, meetings and events day by day, with a
week strip, the user's unavailability, and adding a meeting, an event or a
task on the picked day.

"Mine" shows the user's own activities, as on My work. "Team", for users
with a team, adds what the desktop calendar's Team view adds (the All
Activities list rule), optionally narrowed to some members; the choice is
kept in the session. With the calendar app installed, the types shown follow
the desktop calendar's type filter (``UserCalendarPreference``), and the
filter saved here is that one.
