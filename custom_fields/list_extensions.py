"""
Inject custom fields into list views through ListExtension (_inherit_list),
targeting the shared ``HorillaListView`` base class.

Every concrete list view (``LeadListView``, ``OpportunityListView``, etc.,
across every CRM app, present and future) inherits ``get_context_data`` from
this one base class. Registering ``_inherit_list`` against each concrete
subclass individually would require custom_fields to know every list view
in every app in advance — the opposite of "generic, not hardcoded."

``horilla.extension.list.resolve.resolve_list_view_class`` — the same
resolver every ``_inherit_list`` registration goes through at
``as_view()`` time — checks an exact match for the concrete class first,
then falls back to checking each base class in the concrete class's MRO. A
registration on ``HorillaListView`` here is therefore picked up by every
concrete list view automatically, the same way registering directly on
``LeadListView`` would be for just that one view. See
``horilla/extension/list/resolve.py``'s ``_resolve_via_base_class`` and
``docs/horilla/extension/list/inherit.md`` for the mechanism.
